## Description 
An open-source web app to quickly and easily create a README file by using a command-line application to generate one.

## Installation
The application can be invoked by using the following command: node index.js

## Usage 
A command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the "Inquirer package". The generated file contains everything that a high-quality, professional README should contain.

## Contributing
Why you should contribute to an open-source project? Contributing to open-source is a rewarding way to learn, teach, and build experience in just about any skill. You don’t have to contribute code, there’s always a task for you on an open-source project. Besides coding, you can contribute to user interface design, graphic design, writing, or organizing.

## Tests
Testing should be carried out by following the best practices.
